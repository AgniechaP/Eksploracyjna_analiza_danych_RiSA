Hi, today it will be a pleasure for me to tell you a few words about "No monsters" dystopian animated short film by dead sound which you are able to find on youtube channel. 

The movie is a part of a longer-story about dystopian world Autodale. Autodale is ruled by robots where only pretty people will survive and ugly people are trying to avoid being killed. By pretty people author means people subordinated to the system and ugly people who have some deffects and have to hide their emotions under the masks or are exeptional.

The short movie "No monsters" is about an exeptional child and her mom reading a story before sleep. The bed-time story is about how wonderful is Autodale, how safe it is and why there is no thing to worry about. The mom is convincing her dougher that there are no monsters and there is no risk for such a pretty girl, but she knows from her young age that there is something wrong about Autodale.

Then we can see short film cut about future of that little girl who is running away from the robots and the system. Because she was exeptional, robots decided not to kill her but to use her brain in the "model citizen" society. She tried hard to break the system but now her brain is a huge part of controlling it. 

In my point of view I can see many references to the current world in this film. That sometimes is hard to be exeptional and not to follow strict rules, especially when they are restricting fundamental human rights. While reading comments under this short "No monsters" movie I caught many references to different industries and real-life examples. I find this movie suitable for today's world. Thank you for listening, I will be happy to dispel any doubts.
